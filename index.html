			Let's consider some examples of how technology is integral to our daily lives. When you get up in the morning, you
			probably get out of a bed. The synthetic materials of the mattress upon which you were sleeping, and springs underneath,
			are both examples of technology.
			
			If you're like many millions of people, you probably turn on the computer pretty quickly after waking. A computer is one
			of the most advanced pieces of technology we've ever come up with as humans, and the processes of making the computer's
			parts are all also technology.
			
			It would be impossible to list every single example of technology in our daily lives. Whether it's practical (like
			washing machines, tumble dryers, refrigerators, cars, flooring materials, windows, or door handles) or for leisure (like
			televisions, Blu-ray players, games consoles, reclining chairs, or toys), all these things are examples of technology.
